In this post, I'll discuss the acoustic echo issue in communication systems and how the LMS filter can be used for Acoustic Echo Cancellation.

<h2>1. Problem Setup</h2>
<p>In an <strong>acoustic echo cancellation</strong> system:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <strong>far-end signal</strong> (e.g., voice from a remote speaker) is played through a loudspeaker.</li>
    <li>Some portion of this sound <strong>reflects off surfaces</strong> and <strong>leaks back</strong> into the microphone as an echo.</li>
    <li>The goal is to <strong>remove this echo</strong> from the microphone signal while preserving the near-end speech.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. LMS Adaptive Filtering Approach</h2>
<p>An <strong>adaptive filter</strong> attempts to model the <strong>echo path</strong> and subtract the estimated echo from the microphone signal.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 18px">
    <li>\( x(n) \) → <strong>Far-end signal</strong> (input to the loudspeaker)</li>
    <li>\( d(n) \) → <strong>Microphone signal</strong> (contains both near-end speech + echo)</li>
    <li>\( y(n) \) → <strong>Adaptive filter output</strong> (estimated echo)</li>
    <li>\( e(n) = d(n) - y(n) \) → <strong>Error signal</strong> (ideally just the near-end speech)</li>
</ul>

<p>The LMS filter updates its weights to minimize the squared error:</p>
<p>\[ w(n+1) = w(n) + \mu e(n) x(n) \]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( w(n) \) → Adaptive filter coefficients</li>
    <li>\( \mu \) → Step size (controls convergence speed vs. stability)</li>
    <li>\( e(n) \) → Error signal</li>
    <li>\( x(n) \) → Input signal</li>
</ul>
